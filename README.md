# Radioactive isotope decay simulation model

This python script simulates the radiactive decay for 1000000 isotopes based on probability of >90 and >80 %

By assuming a constant rate of decay for both the probabilities the delta for rate is larger for probability >80% as seen in the plot below with orange line.
